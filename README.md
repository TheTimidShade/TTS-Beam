## Changelog
Read below for complete changelog history.

### 07/11/2021
- Fixed default settings for modules having incorrect types. Beam Strike and Orbital Bombardment modules should not cause errors when using default settings anymore.

### 14/10/2021
Applied changes from script version:
- Removed delay before ZEN module initialisation so modules should appear in Zeus instantly now.
- Cleaned up ZEN related functions to be more consistent with other TTS scripts.
- ZEN modules are now under their own category 'TTS Beam Laser' instead of 'Fire Support' so it is easier to find and doesn't clutter up the other fire support options.
- Fixed an issue that was causing close consecutive beam strikes to destroy the sound emitter from the previous strike.
- Added 'blue' colour back in the ZEN module colours list.
- Added a new function `fn_orbitalBombardment` and a complementary ZEN module because overkill is underrated.
